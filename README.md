# About this Library

This library is intended to be used for populating device images in [NetBox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox)
version 2.7 or later. It contains a set of device images in PNG format and arranged by manufacturer. Each
file represents front and rear of a physical device type (e.g. make and model). These images can be loaded into NetBox to
obviate the need to create device images .
